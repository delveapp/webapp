Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users

  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # root 'welcome#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end

  root 'home#index'

  get 'api/home/top_menu_items' => 'home#top_menu_items'
  get 'api/home/get_search_results' => 'home#search_by_user_selected_category'

  get 'api/restaurant/get_restaurant_info' => 'restaurant#get_restaurant_by_url_title'

  get 'api/menu_item/get_menu_item_info' => 'menu_item#get_menu_item_by_id'

  get 'api/score' => 'score#index'
  post 'api/score' => 'score#create_or_update'
  #put 'api/score' => 'score#update'

  match 'users/:id' => 'user#destroy', :via => :delete, :as => :admin_destroy_user
  resources :users

  get "*path" => 'home#index'
end
